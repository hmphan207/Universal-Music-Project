# Universal-Music-Project

Team members: Huyen Phan, Tyler Yun, and James Yang.

An iOS application that centralizes the streaming of music into one universal platform using Spotify and Apple Music. 
The music application is not only a playlist editor but also incorporate its own media player to allow users to come straight from the application and listen to music from various services on one platform. Songs searched for and liked by users will have the ability to directly add the songs to a selected playlist from the media player.
